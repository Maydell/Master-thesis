abstract="Computer games are big business, which is also reflected in the growing interest in competitive gaming, the so-called electronic sports. Multi-player online battle arena games are among the most successful games in this regard. In order to execute complex team-based strategies, players take on very specific roles within a team. This paper investigates the applicability of supervised machine learning to classifying player behavior in terms of specific and commonly accepted but not formally well-defined roles within a team of players of the game Dota 2. We provide an in-depth discussion and novel approaches for constructing complex attributes from low-level data extracted from replay files. Using attribute evaluation techniques, we are able to reduce a larger set of candidate attributes down to a manageable number. Based on this resulting set of attributes, we compare and discuss the performance of a variety of supervised classification algorithms. Our results with a data set of 708 labeled players see logistic regression as the overall most stable and best performing classifier.",

abstract = {Based on a very large dataset of over 100 million Steam platform users we present the first comprehensive analysis of hardcore gamer profiles by over 700,000 hardcore players (users playing more than 20 hours per week) covering more than 3,300 games. Using an unsupervised machine learning approach we reveal the specific behavioral categories of hardcore players, i.e. First Person Shooter, Team Fortress 2 player, Action game player, Dota 2 player, Strategy and action combiner, Genre-switching player. Subsequently we derive individual patterns of hardcore gamers in the categories found, such as strategy-action games combiner or game switching players. Our results are useful for computer science and information systems scholars interested in individual differences in user behavior as well as practitioners interested in game-designing.},

abstract = {Behavioral data from computer games can be exceptionally high-dimensional, of massive scale and cover a temporal segment reaching years of real-time and a varying population of users. Clustering of user behavior provides a way to discover behavioral patterns that are actionable for game developers. Interpretability and reliability of clustering results is vital, as decisions based on them affect game design and thus ultimately revenue. Here case studies are presented focusing on clustering analysis applied to high-dimensionality player behavior telemetry, covering a combined total of 260,000 characters from two major commercial game titles: the Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game Tera and the multi-player strategy war game Battlefield 2: Bad Company 2. K-means and Simplex Volume Maximization clustering were applied to the two datasets, combined with considerations of the design of the games, resulting in actionable behavioral profiles. Depending on the algorithm different insights into the underlying behavior of the population of the two games are provided.},
